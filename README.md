# Rebuttal Material: Hyperspectral Imaging with Random Printed Mask

# Comparative Experiment(#R1):

To further support the effectiveness and practicality of our method, we have done some comparative experiments. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of reconstruction results are conducted. 

  ## Qualitative comparison:

> Fig. 1: Simulation results. The synthetic RGB images, errormap over all bands and the spectral response of scene point are provided. The experimental results in second column is from the same CNN model as ours on RGB images. The third and forth column are respectively the state-of-art HSCNN(2017), Super Spectral network(2017) and Deep CASSI method(2017). All data is tested on the models given by the original author.

Campared with the second column, our idea of printed mask shows better results in terms of errormap and curves, which strongly support that the simple spectral imaging scheme provides a large number of uncorrelated spectral transmission curves to improve reconstructed performance. 


  ## Quantitative comparison:

  Quantitative comparison was also performed. As can be seen from the above table, our method is not only practical and simple, but also maintains a good reconstruction performance, which provides a new idea for spectral image coding and acquisition.

# Network structure (#R4)

In order to increase the receptive field (RF) of the model and enable it to integrate the coded information by mask of different size level, a multiscale network model with skip connection is employed since down-sampling operation can effectively increase the observation matrix contains different characteristic information in various scale space. The spatial kenel size of convltional layers is 3Ã—3. With nonlinear relu activation, the network allows for nonlinear reconstruction of hyperspectral information, which fits better the nonlinear nature of the problem, and thus leads to better results.

The network structure includes 4 downsamplings to extract features of different scales, spatial pixel of fearure map is  shrunk to half of the previous level after downsampling, and then  original size is maintained after 4 times of upsampling. Bottleneck  whose spatial size is the same as previous layer is added following upsampling to smooth the feature map.  Skipping connection are introduced in our network structure to combine the shallow information and deep feature domain. Sorry, there were some errors in the original schematic which may mislead readers and it is not on purpose. 


# Details (#R2 & #R4)

We thank #R2 for suggesting us to explain more important details about our experiment. Three EPSON XP-245 printer are used to print  colorful ink of different transmission curves on transparent non-deformable film. We investigated many inks on the market, for example 
C13T761280, C13T761380, C13T761480, C13T761580, C13T761680, LAMY T52-Cyan, T52-Magenta T52-Yellow, Pilot INK-30 series, etc. Finally, 7 inks with the weakest correlation of transmission curves are selected . Together with 3 camera response curves, there are total 10  modulation curves.

In practice, the ink-jet printer we used takes a long time to solidify each layer on the PET film, making it difficult to print too many layers.Considering the rank improvement becomes small when the number of layer exceeds $14$, we choose $14$ layers instead of $50$ in practice. We set the magnification of the relay implementation to $2\times$  to make the equivalent droplet size to $8$.The relay mirror contains two lenses A and B, and the focal lengths of A and B are respectively 40mm and 80mm. Finally, we choose the density of the ink droplet to be $p=0.01$, since higher density would cause larger loss in light throughput. It should be pointed out that the meaning of layers are not physically separate sheets but multiple prints on the same sheet.
